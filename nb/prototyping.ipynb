    "The synthetic well log will be convolved with a wavetlet and then will have random noise added.  This will be our synthetic seismic trace.\n",

    "The we will then use only a portion of the synthetic well to simulate the portion recorded by wireline logging.  This will be used to create a synthetic for seismic-to-well tie purposes.\n",
